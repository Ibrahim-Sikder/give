        We believe that organizations that are deeply rooted in local
        communities are in the best position to provide long-term support for
        survivors of crises like these. By funding the efforts of local
        organizations with a long-term track record of working in the affected
        areas, donations to this fund have the potential to build stronger
        response capacity so that people are better equipped to face future
        challenges.

        The projects listed below are led by vetted GlobalGiving partners
