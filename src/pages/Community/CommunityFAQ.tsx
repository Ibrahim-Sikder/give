          Q: Where does the money from the Turkey and Syria Earthquake Relief
          Fund go?
        </h4>
        <p>
          <b> A:</b> A: All donations to this fund will support relief and
          recovery efforts in the region(s) affected by this specific disaster.
          The fund will initially help meet the most urgent and immediate needs,
          including the provision of shelter, medical care, food, and clean
          water. Once initial relief work is complete, money from this fund will
          be allocated by GlobalGiving for longer-term recovery efforts—largely
          led by local organizations. All of GlobalGiving’s nonprofit partners
          are vetted.

        </h4>
        <p>
          <b> A:</b> GlobalGiving has responded to disasters since 2004 and often has long-standing relationships with nonprofits in disaster-prone areas. We also work with global organizations that specialize in emergency response and disaster recovery.

        Q: What makes GlobalGiving different from other nonprofits?
        </h4>
        <p>
          <b> A:</b>Here's how disaster recovery at GlobalGiving works: the GlobalGiving community is made up of large and small nonprofits from 175+ countries. When disasters and crises strike, we are committed to connecting donors to vetted organizations that are immediately responding to needs in the impacted communities. We often support international or regional first responders in the initial stages of relief. However, we believe local, community-led organizations are best positioned to assess and respond to needs in the medium- and long-term, so we listen carefully to what these local leaders deem most critical. Our view is that community-led organizations possess critical knowledge about their communities and can nimbly and effectively navigate unique dynamics in their region. Getting funds to them benefits communities directly, quickly, and with longer-term impact. Learn more about our approach.
